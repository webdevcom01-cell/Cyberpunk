# Prisma Migrations Directory

This directory will contain migration files generated by Prisma.

Each migration is stored in its own directory with:
- migration.sql - The SQL commands to run
- A timestamp for ordering

## How Migrations Work

1. You modify `schema.prisma`
2. Run `npm run db:migrate:dev -- --name your_migration_name`
3. Prisma generates a migration file
4. Migration is applied to database
5. Prisma Client is regenerated

## Production Deployments

In production, run:
```bash
npm run db:deploy
